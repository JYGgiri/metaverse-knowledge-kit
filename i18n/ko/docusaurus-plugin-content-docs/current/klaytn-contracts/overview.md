## Overview <a id="contract overview"></a>
As it stands, the blockchain plays a vital role in bringing real-world value to the rapidly growing metaverse ecosystem. The features of the blockchain can easily be optimized by metaverse applications by leveraging smart contracts. These smart contracts trigger all the actions on the blockchain. For example if a user needs to pay in exchange for a commodity in the metaverse with certain conditions, it can be written as smart contracts.

Smart contracts are simple pieces of code to be executed on the blockchain. It ensures certain predetermined conditions are met before executing an agreement. 

## Use Cases of Smart contract in Metaverse <a id="Usecases of smart contract in Metaverse"></a>

**Trade and Exchange:** In the Metaverse, smart contracts are utilized to automate processes and guarantee that transactions and trade are carried out in conformity with predefined rules. Like real life transactions, all trades and exchanges are governed by smart contracts. This facilitates the creation of a virtual economy with different kinds of utility tokens, NFTs, etc.). For instance, users with their avatars, can enter the metaverse to trade digital assets (wearables, estates, and avatars). 

**Governance and decision-making:** With smart contracts functionality enabled in metaverse applications, users form groups, participate in decision-making activities, cast votes, form groups, pool capital together essentially through a [DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization).

**Upgrade application functionality:** 
Smart contracts make it possible to add new features to Metaverse applications without altering its code.
 
Smart contracts are absolutely needed in the metaverse to increase the security and transparency of transactions within several areas such as eCommerce, real estate, media & entertainment, gaming, and more. Companies such as Meta (Facebook) and Microsoft focused on building a metaverse controlled by a single authority face the limitations of data privacy and the maintenance of infrastructure. Maintaining the infrastructure of this type of metaverse is costly as compared to a metaverse powered by smart contracts and blockchain, which require negligible or no maintenance costs.

## Smart Contracts on Klaytn <a id="Smart contracts on Klaytn"></a>

To write smart contracts, Klaytn currently supports [Solidity](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity) as the primary programming language. Solidity is adopted in Klaytn because it is a de facto standard contract programming language for Ethereum and has a large user base and an active community. The Klaytn team made the decision to offer users a familiar toolset: ***klaytn-contract***, so that developers and Ethereum dApp developers could quickly test new smart contracts or migrate their existing smart contracts to Klaytn.

[klaytn-contracts](https://github.com/klaytn/klaytn-contracts) is an open source smart contract library which provides reusable building blocks for developers to easily use in their Klaytn based projects. It contains a full suite of standardized smart contract interfaces, libraries, and implementations for quick and safe inheritance and development.

Klaytn Improvement Proposal (KIPs) describe standards for the Klaytn platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract standards. In respect to contract standards, token standards have been defined in Klaytn such as [KIP7](https://kips.klaytn.foundation/KIPs/kip-7), [KIP17](https://kips.klaytn.foundation/KIPs/kip-17), [KIP37](https://kips.klaytn.foundation/KIPs/kip-37).
