## Introduction <a id="KIP7 Introduction"></a>
***KIP7*** establishes the implementation of a standard API for [fungible tokens](https://docs.klaytn.foundation/content/smart-contract/token-standard#fungible-token-standard-kip-7) within smart contracts. This standard allows for any token on Klaytn to be reused by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges. KIP7 as a token standard is heavily derived from [ERC20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20), the Ethereum standard interface for fungible tokens. To issue fungible tokens on top of Klaytn, the KIP7 standard specification must be implemented.

## Usecase <a id="KIP7 Usecase"></a>
***KIP7*** tokens provide the standard to establish the in-built currency of a Metaverse. In accordance with this KIP7 standard, tokens are established as digital assets that can be used as a store of value and a means of exchange. With these tokens, users can engage in trade, exchange and every other virtual economic activity.

For example, smart contracts for popular Metaverses such as [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/) and [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/) focus on managing the trading processes for land, avatars, real estate, and other digital assets. Decentraland's native token, [MANA](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/decentraland/), powers the purchase and sales of  everything on Decentraland. [SAND](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/the-sandbox/), the Sandbox's native token, is used in another popular Metaverse.

Conclusively, KIP7 token standard can be used to implement fungible tokens that can be used to pay for everything in your metaverse applications, including avatars, virtual real estate, NFTs, and so on.
