# ðŸŽ¯ Usecase in the Metaverse <a id="Decentralized Oracle Usecase"></a>

Since the metaverse is a representation of our physical world in the digital world, it would require a unique way of passing real-world data or events into the digital world in order to create a decentralized metaverse economy. This is where decentralized oracles come into play. It acts as the middleware connecting the metaverse to real-world data.

A decentralized metaverse economy will require

* **Data Feeds**: For the metaverse to unlock its true economy, it needs to incorporate various financial tools and services. These may include receiving payment, lending and borrowing, staking and investing,  etc. All of the aforementioned can only be possible with the use of oracles.

* **Verifiable Randomness**: The ability to provide verifiable randomness through the use of oracles can unlock tools for decentralized metaverse applications like lotteries, loot boxes, randomized NFT projects, play-to-earn games, raffles, and more. The most immediate use case is [OVR](https://www.overthereality.ai/blog/ovr-using-chainlink-to-connect-the-metaverse-to-real-world-data-and-events/), a decentralized metaverse that allows users to build, host, and visualize AR/VR experiences that are customized to specific geographic locations. They are integrated with a decentralized oracle to fairly and transparently select a special grant fund winner from the list of participants taking part in our upcoming OVRLand Treasure Hunt.

* **Sports Results**: Connecting with sports results has been made easier with the use of oracles. Metaverse users can walk into a virtual betting store to predict their favorite club or player will do well in a football match, and the result or outcome is provided securely by oracles.

* **Weather Result**: With oracles, we can embed weather results in our metaverse application. For example, in the OVR metaverse, each OVRLand can simulate the weather conditions of each physical geographical location it represents.

Other off-chain data such as Geolocation data, deeds of transfer etc.
