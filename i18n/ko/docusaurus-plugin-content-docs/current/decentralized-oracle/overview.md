## Overview <a id="Decentralized Oracle Overview"></a>

Connecting the blockchain to outside data is one of the challenges facing blockchain systems. Traditionally, blockchains work as a closed system, meaning they cannot fetch data from off-chain and make it available for smart contract use on-chain. This is where oracles play a crucial role in ensuring that smart contracts can access data stored outside the blockchain network and also  execute depending on real-world inputs and outputs.

## What is a decentralized oracle? <a id="What is decentralized oracles"></a>

Oracle, as the name implies, is not a tool for seeing into the future of cryptocurrency prices, but rather a useful tool that acts as a "bridge," connecting smart contracts to off-chain data. This implies that any kind of real-world data, like sports results, the price of crypto, a deed of transfer, weather data, or geolocation data, can be sourced, verified by oracles, and transmitted to smart contracts running on the blockchain.

 As a useful tool, it is not only limited to getting off-chain data into smart contracts but also pushing information from the blockchain to off-chain data providers. With oracles, users can utilize blockchains in a huge variety of ways in their daily lives.

 For example, letâ€™s assume Jude and Jane want to bet on the outcome of a sports match. Jude bets $10 on team A, and Jane bets $10 on team B, with the $20 to be paid to the winner held in escrow by a smart contract. The game outcome and winner payout can only be facilitated with the help of oracles providing the match outcome in a secure and reliable manner.

## How do they work? <a id="How do they work"></a>

Blockchain oracles are an important aspect of most blockchain applications. They function as a bridge to connect blockchain to real-world data, thus making it a middleware system. In order for these middleware systems to solve the blockchain oracle problem, they devise various mechanisms to do so. However, the majority of oracles rely on the same concept.

They function like an API, which, on request, queries an external data source for the desired data. After successfully querying the data, it's been verified, validated, and broadcast on the blockchain. With this data, smart contracts can trustlessly execute upon specific conditions being met.

## What are the benefits? <a id="What are the benefits"></a>

Blockchain oracles are extremely important in their role as a bridge between blockchains and off-chain data. Some of these include:

1. **Increased functionality**: Oracles allow smart contracts to access data from external sources, which can greatly expand the capabilities and use cases of the contract.

2. **Improved trust and security**: Oracles can be used to verify and authenticate data before it is passed to a smart contract, which helps to improve the overall trust and security of the blockchain.

3. **Greater flexibility**: By allowing smart contracts to access external data, oracles can make the blockchain more flexible and adaptable to different use cases and industries.

4. **Real-world integration**: Oracles can bridge the gap between the digital world of the blockchain and the physical world by allowing smart contracts to interact with real-world data and events.

4. **Automation**: Oracles can automate the process of data collection and feeding it to the smart contract, making the process of data collection more efficient and less time-consuming.
