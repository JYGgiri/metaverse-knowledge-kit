# Create a New Unity Project <a id="Create a New Unity Project"></a>

The SDK / Unity plugin supports all Unity project types. In this example, you will see how to create an empty 3D project.

To create a new project, open **Unity Hub** and select **All templates**. 
We will use a 3D template, then click on **Create project**.

Now, you have created a new project, we need to import the SDK into our project.

Drag the downloaded web3.unitypackage file in the [Installation]() section into the Unity project.
