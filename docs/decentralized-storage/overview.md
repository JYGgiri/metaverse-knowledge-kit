## Overview <a id="Decentralized Storage Overview"></a>

Data storage is inevitable for every company or individual, big or small. Data serves as the bloodstream for the daily operation of certain systems that exist in businesses or individual operations. Over the years, we have seen trends in how data has been stored, from paper storage to physical media devices to cloud storage solutions. 

As businesses grow, they experience an increase in data, both from internal and external sources, which leads to complexity in storing, processing, analyzing, and retrieving this data. As a result, businesses have traditionally relied on centralized storage to store customer information and other sensitive data on the internet. These data storage solutions are not solely the best fit, as they are vulnerable to cyberattacks and other security risks, hence the need to store data in a secure and reliable way.

 In a scalable decentralized web, one of the crucial underlying layers is its storage system. The blockchain, which powers the decentralized web, can be seen as decentralized storage. In this case, it is not one to store large files but solely for storing transaction data, smart contracts, and codes. Storing large files on-chain might be very expensive and also increase access latency.

 As such, the widespread use of blockchain technology brought about the concept of "decentralized cloud storage" as an alternative to centralized cloud storage. Before diving into decentralized storage, let's take a look at some of the problems associated with centralized storage solutions.


## Shortcomings of a Centralized Storage System <a id="Shortcomings of a Centralized Storage System"></a>

1. **Lack of Ownership and Control**: In a centralized storage system, data is stored on the central server of the host. The hosts have the ability to monitor, censor, or even disclose any data to third parties, making the data not solely yours.
  
2. **Data Breaches and Security Risks**: All major players have experienced data [breaches](https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/28/everything-you-need-to-know-about-facebooks-data-breach-affecting-50m-users/)  in the past few years. Additionally, centralized storage systems may also be at risk from natural disasters, power outages, and other physical hazards.
  
3. **Storage Costs**: This means storage providers charge exorbitant prices for bandwidth transmission as well as data security costs because centralized storage is easier to attack.

## What is Decentralized Storage? <a id="What is Decentralized Storage?"></a>

Decentralized storage (also known as dStorage) is a system of data storage in which data is distributed into different chunks and stored inside various nodes of a [peer-to-peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer) (P2P) network. Decentralized storage makes use of blockchain technology, a peer-to-peer networking system, to ensure a tamper-proof system for data storage and sharing.

dStorage, just like traditional storage systems, enables us to upload and store data. As a unique feature of decentralized storage, files uploaded are encrypted, thus ensuring data and file security, and downloading a file from a dStorage entails downloading various fragments of the file from a P2P network until the full file is downloaded.

Unlike centralized storage, the following are the benefits of leveraging decentralized storage.

* **Minimal file loss**:  With potentially millions of nodes participating to store data, extra copies of your data can be stored on different nodes across various regions to avoid file loss in the event of unforeseen circumstances.
* **Low storage cost**: The decentralized storage network comprises millions of nodes willing to host data. As such, this provides a large amount of storage bandwidth, thus enabling a reduction in the cost of storage.
* **High Security and Privacy**: Data stored on decentralized storage is encrypted, making it secure. Furthermore, data is being split into chunks, encrypted and stored so that no one person can access your data or even know what you are storing.
