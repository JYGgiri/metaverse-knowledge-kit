## Overview

The concept of "metaverse" started as an imaginative world explored in fictional books. Notable books like  "Snow Crash‚Äù by Neal Stephenson's and ‚ÄúReady Player One‚Äú by Ernest Cline speculated what the metaverse might look like. However, different innovations and technological advancements over the years have driven us closer to the concepts of the metaverse outside of fictional books. As a result, it has drawn growing interest as a potential digital space for both social and economic interaction.

Curious about this buzzword Metaverse? Let‚Äôs dive in!

## Defining the Metaverse <a id="Defining Metaverse"></a>

The metaverse is still in its infancy which makes it an ambiguous concept. This developing concept may have several definitions in the virtual world. However, the general idea is that it is a simulation of any real world environment in the virtual space. The metaverse tends to allow users work, meet, play games, and socialize together in the 3D [virtual worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_world). 

The metaverse is driven by various technologies ranging from the use of [Virtual Reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality)(VR), [Augmented Reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality)(AR), [Artificial Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) (AI), [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency), [NFTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token) and other elements of Web3. A practical example of what a day in metaverse would look like is attending a meeting with an Oculus VR headset in your virtual office and after work attend a virtual concert, buy your favorite nike collection in a virtual store, relax by playing a blockchain-based game, manage your crypto assets all inside the metaverse.  

Over the years, virtual video game worlds have brought a look-alike metaverse feel because it enables 3D virtual reality. These game worlds are not the metaverse, but they are somewhat similar.  For the metaverse to get into its full potential, we will need to incorporate AI for adaptability, [UI/UX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface_design) design for usability, [Cloud technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing) for scalability, AR/VR for better experience, [IOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) for connectivity and Blockchain for decentralisation and transparency. 

## Importance of Blockchain in the Metaverse <a id="Importance of Blockchain in the Metaverse"></a>

Beyond the 3D virtual reality provided by metaverse, there are other components that help incorporate our physical worlds in the digital space. 

For example, ability to:

* Prove your identity just like in real world;
* Perform financial transactions;
* Own assets in the virtual world.

Building a decentralized metaverse economy requires all of these elements and more, and here is where blockchain technology is crucial. Anyone can implement economies, digital identities, decentralized governance in Metaverse using Blockchain in a transparent and immutable way. Blockchain can be utilized for: 

* Transfer of value through wallets
* Digital Possession using NFT‚Äôs
* Proof of ownership using smart contracts
* Decentralized governance using DAO‚Äôs

Firstly, the blockchain can provide a secure and trustless means for users to transfer value within the metaverse. To achieve this, blockchain offers digital currencies as a primary mode of exchange and store of value used in trading activities in the metaverse without the need of a central financial institution. 

Secondly, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are unique digital assets that can never be forged. These digital possessions represent users' avatars, plots of land, and other objects in the metaverse. For example, in Decentraland, users can rent their plots of land in the metaverse and earn crypto.

Thirdly, by owning a wallet with access to  private keys, you can prove the ownership of an asset on the blockchain and you can also create tamper-proof  and verifiable transactions. 

Futhermore, just like in real life, where we can vote and partake in decison-making activities, the blockchain provides a proven way to enable users decide governance within the metaverse. 

Lastly, in a future where various platforms offer different metaverse experiences, blockchain serves a clear purpose. It enables user portability across platforms and allows users to transfer their assets and digital possessions with them across various platforms.

## Usecases of Metaverse <a id="Usecases of Metaverse"></a>

* **Virtual Offices**: During the pandemic, we were ushered into a new work-from home concept. As a result, there came an increase in Zoom meetings which gave a non-immersive experience to its users. With metaverse, users have access to immersive experience and a 3D virtual reality which increases user productivity and interactivity.
* **Real Estates**: Just like how we buy and sell properties in real life, this phenomenon is powered by NFTs in the metaverse. Individuals and top enterprises can invest and buy real-estates in the metaverse. Over the years, we have witnessed a boom in the real estate industry where companies like Decentraland, The Sandbox are pioneers of a metaverse where virtual plots are represented with NFTs.
* **Virtual Event and Social Interaction**: During the pandemic, real world events took place in the virtual world. A notable example is Travis Scott virtual concert with over 12 million users in the popular video game Fortnite. 
* **Virtual Shopping**: With the advent of 3D virtual worlds, users can enter into shops and explore the products virtually 	without having to necessarily	travel to the venue. For example, Gucci hosted a virtual exhibition that led to the sale of a virtual product including $12.99 sneakers and $4000 handbag which later sold for $25,000
* **Education**: Students will experience an interactive learning environment and as a result they are not limited to geographical barriers.
