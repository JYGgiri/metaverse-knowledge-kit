# Klaytn Metaverse Docs

The Klaytn Gaming & Metaverse Package is a collection of tools and services developed in the Klaytn ecosystem to empower developers and accelerate the development of amazing web3 projects on Klaytn. The resources will help you to get the right information to build your game and metaverse projects. This documentation is divided into 3 categories:

**Informational Content**: provides context of NFT standards, best practices, links to relevant existing libraries tooling, as well as documentation and tutorials on how to use those resources. Maybe some starter kits with default combinations of tools and configurations.

**Package Support**: are either built npm packages which wrap functionality of these various tools into an easy to use SDK (per tool), or links, tutorials, and documentation on how to use existing tooling SDK packages.

**API Support**: is a unified standardized API which covers all of the Informational Content and Package support tooling functionality, as well as standard IPFS data fetching.
