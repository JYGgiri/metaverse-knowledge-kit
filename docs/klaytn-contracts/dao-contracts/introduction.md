## Introduction <a id="DAO Introduction"></a>
The advent of blockchain technology has resulted in a significant shift in traditional organizational structure. The traditional organizational structure encourages top-level authority to decide on management, operations, and actions, giving coordination to a central authority. Because of the blockchain's decentralized nature, coordination and management of an organization can be delegated to all members, removing the need for centralized control.

In contrast to traditional organizations, DAOs are community-driven entities that do not require central authority or coordination. All members now have management and coordination power, and they can make proposals, cast votes, and make decisions in the best interests of the organization.

The following are some of the benefits of running an organization in a decentralized way:

* **Transparency**: All proposals and votes can be viewed publicly on the blockchain. This enhances transparency and accountability because all members will want to act honestly.
* **Community-driven**: People with similar interests are brought together to work toward a common goal. As a result, a DAO allows people from all over the world to collaborate on a common goal.
* **No-central Authority**: Decisions in a DAO are not made by a central authority.

## How does a DAO work? <a id="How do DAO’s work"></a>

Smart contracts can be used to program the functionality of a DAO. Governance abilities such as creating new proposals, casting votes, and finalising proposals are all possible and readily available on-chain. Remember that all of this is done by members of the community, not by a central authority.

Members, ideally, agree on decisions after raising a proposal in the first instance. If the proposal is supported by the majority of stakeholders, it is automatically implemented. For example, based on the result of a members’ vote, a code may be triggered to mint a predetermined amount of tokens held in the DAO’s custody to a specified blockchain address.  

DAO members frequently invest their funds in the form of tokens to achieve a common goal. These members' tokens typically represent their proportionate voting rights. For example in some DAO's, member who owns 100 tokens has twice the voting power of a member who owns 50 tokens. This practice is viewed positively because individuals who have a greater financial stake in the DAO are more motivated to do what is best for the organization.

Having said that, DAO members have the option of making proposals for the project's future. The following categories represent some of the critical decisions made by DAO members:

* **Technical Upgrades**: Token holders may submit proposals for distributing DAO funds for bug fixes and system upgrades in this case. People interested in the protocol may be compensated in this case if they assist with bug fixes or system upgrades.
* **Treasury Pooling Allocation**: Members can use the DAO funds to take advantage of a profitable investment opportunity. Investing in valuable assets is one example (NFTs).


## Usecase <a id="DAO Usecase"></a>
It is established that the metaverse offers real-world experience to users via a virtually connected ecosystem. Having said that, the demand for a decentralized community will grow as users from various groups associate and connect in the metaverse. A decentralized community called DAO will be essential to the development of an efficient  metaverse.

The following are some of the applications of DAO in the Metaverse:

1. **Overall Governance**
   
The presence of DAOs in the metaverse enhances a decentralized governing model. As such, community members take the lead in defining the future prospects of the protocol by voting and reaching an agreement.

For instance, the [Decentraland](https://docs.decentraland.org/player/general/dao/dao-userguide/) is structured as a DAO, allowing each member to participate in voting processes for decisions regarding new wearables for user avatars, the management of land auctions, and the opening of requests for grants for property development. Additionally, the total balance of MANA, NAMES, and LAND linked to the wallet connected to the DAO is used to calculate each member's voting power.

2. **Shared Ownership**
   
With the existence of DAOs in the metaverse, users can now partake in shared ownership schemes. This means that community members can share ownership of NFTs, with cryptocurrency having raised funds to invest in them.

3. **Fundraising**
   
Members of the community can utilize the tokens they purchased to fund and advance the Metaverse project.
