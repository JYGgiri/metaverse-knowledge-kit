This page contains the list of governance tools that can be integrated with dApps to build a DAO in metaverse: 

**1. [Snapshot](https://docs.snapshot.org/)**

Snapshot is a leading decentralized off-chain governance platform that enables protocols/projects to conduct secure decentralized decision-making without having to build the infrastructure from scratch. Read this [guide](https://medium.com/klaytn/using-snapshot-for-your-klaytn-project-governance-1ced3ff6244) on how how to use Snapshot on Klaytn. 

**2. [Klaytn Square](https://square.klaytn.foundation/Home)**

Klaytn Square is a governance platform aimed at enhancing transparency and decentralization within the Klaytn ecosystem. The governance portal provides information about Klaytn Governance Council (GC) members, their KLAY transactions, and staking deposits. With the introduction of [KIP81](https://kips.klaytn.foundation/KIPs/kip-81), this tool seeks to introduce an on-chain voting status feature that also allows users to keep track of GC decision-making progress in real-time. Refer to this [guide](https://medium.com/klaytn/klaytn-square-beta-is-now-available-4038aa9cb8d9) for more information.

**3. [XDAO](https://docs.xdao.app/)**

XDAO is a unique tool for creating Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and jointly managing crypto assets. With XDAO, people of the same interest can create a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, deposit crypto assets, manage them by voting, sell DAO shares, and directly interact with DeFi protocols.
