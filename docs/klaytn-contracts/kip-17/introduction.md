# Introduction <a id="KIP17 Introduction"></a>
[KIP17](https://kips.klaytn.foundation/KIPs/kip-17) as part of the KIPs for the Klaytn platform, establishes the implementation of a standard API for [Non-Fungible Tokens](https://docs.klaytn.foundation/content/smart-contract/token-standard#non-fungible-token-standard-kip-17)(NFTs)  within smart contracts.  NFTs can represent ownership over digital or physical assets. For example, it can be used to represent digital art, game items, or any kind of unique assets and allow people to trade them. 

KIP17 as a token standard is heavily derived from [ERC721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721), the Ethereum standard interface for non-fungible tokens. To issue non-fungible tokens on top of Klaytn, the KIP17 standard specification must be implemented.

# Usecase <a id="KIP17 Introduction"></a>
As it has been established, Metaverse is the virtual representation of the physical world.  With the use of NFTs, real world assets ranging from houses, land, car, furniture and other goods can be represented in the metaverse.   NFTs when integrated in your metaverse applications, allows for:

**Virtual Land Ownership:** Nfts can be used to buy and sell land in the metaverse. A practical example is [Orbcity](https://orbcity.io/), a decentralized virtual world where users can explore, and upgrade their cities and districts. In this land-fi metaverse, districts are represented as NFTs.

**Trade of Virtual Products:** The sales of digital goods such as wears, art, and other products are being facilitated in the Metaverse with the use of NFTs

**Ownership:** One of the importance of NFTs in the metaverse is ownership. Users can now own products and have a sense of belonging. For example gaming applications in the metaverse can represent in-game assets such as skins, tanks etc with NFTs.

**Digital community and Social experience:** NFTs are important in the metaverse for enhancing digital communities and social interaction. For example, users can buy NFTs to get access to premium communities in the Metaverse.

The KIP17 token standard can be used to implement non-fungible tokens in your metaverse application to power the above use cases.
