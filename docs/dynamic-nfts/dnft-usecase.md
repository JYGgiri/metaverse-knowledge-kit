# Usecases <a id="dNFT Usecases"> </a>

The following are some dNFT use-cases in the metaverse:

**Digital assets:** In the metaverse, one application of dynamic NFT is using dNFT to represent user avatars that change based on emotion levels, whether sad, happy, or anxious, time of day, or weather condition. 

**Game Items & collectibles:** Static NFTs have been proven and used to represent a wide variety of things, like sports collectibles and in-game assets such as skins, potions, swords, etc. The introduction of dNFT in metaverse gaming applications offers unique features that make sports collectibles and game items stand out.

For example, a dNFT sport collectible enables each player's stats to get updated throughout the season as traits on their respective NFT collectible. Furthermore, unlike how static NFTs are used in games, dNFTs pose a unique feature in how NFTs are used in character-progression games. For example, a dynamic NFT sword could become more powerful the more it is used in battle.

**Loyalty Programs:** Dynamic NFTs can be used in metaverse loyalty programs. A user, for example, could earn an NFT for every $1000 spent in a metaverse store. 

**Tokenization of real world assets:** Another use case where NFT metadata changes are useful is in the tokenization of real-world assets. For example, in the metaverse, a dNFT can be used to represent land that can change due to its development, market value, and more.
