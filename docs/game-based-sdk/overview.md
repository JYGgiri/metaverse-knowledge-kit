# Overview <a id="Gaming SDK Overview"></a>

With recent waves and attention to NFTs, a wealth of gaming developers have been exposed to the value it brings to the gaming industry. Originally, developers build games using game engines. However when it comes to building a game that integrates with web3, there lacks a bridge between gaming engines like Unity/Unreal and the blockchain layer like Klaytn. 

The need to build infrastructure that enables gaming developers to seamlessly integrate into the crypto ecosystem, brought about the need for web3 gaming sdks. This enables game developers to build use cases around NFTs, play-to-earn, GameFi, and more. Additionally, builders of the Metaverse deserve the best tooling to create the next wave of metaverse gaming applications.

These SDKs make it easy for game developers to integrate the following capabilities into their metaverse gaming applications:

* Support Web3 wallets for in-game transactions
* Integrate NFT capabilities like minting, renting, and trading
* Launch and distribute in-game currency as tokens
* Optimize games for Web3 on mobile

# Usecase <a id="Gaming SDK Usecase"></a>
The non-existence of a bridge connecting gaming engines to the blockchain is the core purpose of web3 gaming SDKs. With these SDKs, developers have access to the right tools for the job and can seamlessly integrate into any crypto ecosystem for their gaming application.

An example is [Arsenal](https://arsenal.fabwelt.com/), a 3D first-person battleground shooter with NFT. It integrated with a gaming SDK to achieve the following:

* To enable players to connect to a blockchain wallet
 
* Allow players to access in-game NFTs so as to enable pay-to-play and play-to-earn.

To create a blockchain-enabled metaverse gaming application, gaming SDKs are an important tool for tapping into the value that blockchain offers. [ChainSafe](https://docs.gaming.chainsafe.io/) is an example of gaming SDKs integrated with Klaytn.
